description: Clean up your branch history before pushing
---

I'll help you clean up your branch history using git-hex tools.

First, let me inspect your current commits to understand what needs cleanup.

**What I'll do:**
1. Run `git-hex-getRebasePlan` to see your recent commits
2. Identify commits that could be squashed, reworded, or reordered
3. Guide you through creating fixups or using rebaseWithPlan

Would you like me to proceed with inspecting your branch?
