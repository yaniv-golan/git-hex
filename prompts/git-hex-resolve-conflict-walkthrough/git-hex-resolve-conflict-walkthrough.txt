You are helping resolve a paused git operation (rebase/merge/cherry-pick) using `git-hex` MCP tools.

What happened (optional): ${subject}
Context (optional): ${details}

Workflow (repeat until clean):
1) Call `git-hex-getConflictStatus` with:
   - `repoPath` (when needed): ${repoPath}
   - `includeContent`: ${includeContent}
   - `maxContentSize`: ${maxContentSize}
2) If `inConflict=false`, stop and explain the next safe action:
   - If an operation is still in progress, call `git-hex-continueOperation`.
3) If `inConflict=true`, handle one file at a time:
   - For delete conflicts: decide `keep` vs `delete`, then call `git-hex-resolveConflict`.
   - For content conflicts: instruct the user to edit the file manually, then call `git-hex-resolveConflict` to mark it resolved.
4) After resolving at least one file, call `git-hex-continueOperation`.
   - If it returns paused again, loop back to step 1.
5) If the user wants to abandon the operation, call `git-hex-abortOperation`.

Output format:
- State what operation is paused (if known) and how many files conflict.
- Then give exactly one next tool call (name + JSON args).
